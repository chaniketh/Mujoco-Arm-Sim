## 🦾 MuJoCo Arm Simulation – Software-Only Dynamic Target Interception

This project is a purely software-based robotic arm simulation built in MuJoCo, inspired by a Fruit Ninja–style interaction.

Virtual spherical targets (balls) are programmatically launched into the simulation environment, and the simulated robotic arm reacts in real time by moving toward the incoming target and making contact within the physics engine. All perception, motion planning, and control logic are handled entirely in software.

### 🔹 Key Features
- Fully software-based simulation with no physical hardware
- Physics-accurate environment using MuJoCo
- Real-time target tracking and interception
- Smooth joint-space control of a multi-DOF arm
- End-effector contact interaction with moving objects

### 🔹 What This Demonstrates
- Robotic arm control in a simulated dynamic environment
- Trajectory planning toward moving targets
- Timing and coordination under physics constraints
- Use of simulation as a testbed for control algorithms

### 🔹 Scope
- No sensors or hardware integration
- No real-world deployment
- Focused entirely on simulation, control logic, and physics-based interaction

This project serves as a controlled software test environment for experimenting with dynamic manipulation strategies using robotic arms.
